* Installation
** Linux
Just use the keyboard layout german (~de~) with variant ~neo~ installed in every linux operating system.

** Windows
Download the reNeo.exe from the homepage and execute it while having your windows keyboard layout set to German(DE).

** MacOS
Download the layout definition from github:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/jgosmann/neo2-layout-osx.git
#+end_src

To fully enable all features, you need to download the software Karabiner with my Neo2 extension of the original configuration.
